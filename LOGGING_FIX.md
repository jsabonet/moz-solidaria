# üêõ Django Logging Error Fix

## Problem
Django was failing with the error:
```
ValueError: Unable to configure handler 'audit_file'
FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'logs/audit.log'
```

## Root Cause
The logging configuration was trying to create log files in a directory that didn't exist.

## Solution Applied
Updated `backend/moz_solidaria_api/settings.py` with:

1. **Automatic directory creation**: The logs directory is now created automatically
2. **Graceful fallback**: If file logging fails, Django falls back to console logging
3. **Production-ready**: Different logging paths for development and production
4. **Error handling**: Proper exception handling for permission issues

## Files Modified
- `backend/moz_solidaria_api/settings.py` - Updated logging configuration
- `backend/check_setup.py` - Added setup verification script

## How to Test
```bash
cd backend
python check_setup.py          # Verify setup
python manage.py check          # Check Django configuration
python manage.py migrate        # Run database migrations
python manage.py collectstatic  # Collect static files
python manage.py runserver      # Start development server
```

## Features Added
- ‚úÖ Automatic logs directory creation
- ‚úÖ Write permission testing
- ‚úÖ Graceful fallback to console logging
- ‚úÖ Production vs development logging paths
- ‚úÖ Setup verification script

## Status
‚úÖ **FIXED** - All Django commands now work properly

The application is ready for both development and production deployment.
